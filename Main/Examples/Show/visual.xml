    <!-- Snaphot images are taken with a cineatic camera with depth of field. Several rays are emitted per pixel (rows x cols x rays_per_pixel). The more rays per pixel are emitted, the less noisy the image's depth of field will be, but the longer it takes to be calculated. For a strong depth of field, choose a small focal_length_over_aperture_diameter, e.g. 0.95, and a large sensor size e.g. 70mm. For a moderate human like depth of field, choose focal_length_over_aperture_diameter=2.8 and image_sensor_size_along_a_row=25mm. -->
